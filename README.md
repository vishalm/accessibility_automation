# Accessibility Automation
Helping communities by providing very simple example for accessibility test automation.

## Why
  * The whole idea is to shift left accessibility testing.
  * One can find examples, samples distributed but this repo will provide correct testing tooling and with: 
    ** test framework setup
    ** reporting the results
    ** tips to add in jenkins pipeline
    ** And many more.
 

## How
  ### Tech Stack
   * node
   * javascript stack 
   * Examples using:
    * a11y 
    * pa11y 
    * axe 
    * lighthouse
    * continuum
  * Test framework : Jest
  * Browser controle : Selenium, Webdriverio, Puppeteer

## Reports
  * Default test framework report for jest execution to support CI
  * But the important part getting the report of accessibility concerns and all the examples have associated ways to create       CSV reports.

## Which example to choose.
`This I will leave it to you.`
I have some prefferences but whichever suites you better go ahead and consume.

## Docker support
  * Will add more in this section
