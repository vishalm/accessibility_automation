# Accessibility Automation

Helping communities by providing very simple example for accessibility test automation.

## Why

* The whole idea is to shift left accessibility testing.
* One can find examples, samples distributed but this repo will provide correct testing tooling and with: 
  * test framework setup
  * reporting the results
  * tips to add in jenkins pipeline
  * And many more.

## How
  
### Tech Stack

* node
* javascript stack
* Examples
  * a11y
  * pa11y
  * axe
  * lighthouse
  * continuum
* Test framework
* Jest
  * Browser controle
  * Selenium
  * Webdriverio
  * Puppeteer

* #### axe: Accessibility for Development Teams Start building accessibility into your dev process today
  
  * axe <https://www.deque.com/axe/>
  * The axe team maintains active channels on Gitter and the A11y workspace on Slack.

## Reports

* Default test framework report for jest execution to support CI
* But the important part getting the report of accessibility concerns and all the examples have associated ways to create       CSV reports.

## Which example to choose.

`This I will leave it to you.`

I have some prefferences but whichever suites you better go ahead and consume.

## Docker support

* Will add more in this section
